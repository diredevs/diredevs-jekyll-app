# Get Stylish!

Grunt handles all stylus configuration. You can configure compiler 
settings in the project's Gruntfile.js.

Require libraries or extensions in the Gruntfile or place them in 
'app/_bower_components'.

The files in this directory are plain css boilerplate. Stylize as you see fit.

For detailed information on configuring stylus with Grunt, see the docs 
at https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-stylus.
